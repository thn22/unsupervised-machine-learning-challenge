# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
## Description of the Project
As a member of a data science team for a medical research company, I have been asked to try and find a better way to predict myopia (nearsightedness). It is believed there are distinct groups of patients that would be best to analyze separately, so my job is to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning. With raw data, I need to first process it to fit machine learning models, then use several algorithms to determine whether or not the patients can be grouped into distinct clusters.


## Languages and Libraries
